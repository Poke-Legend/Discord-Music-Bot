This Discord bot is a simple music bot that allows users to play music from YouTube in a voice channel. Here are the main functionalities of the bot:

Play Music: Users can use the command !play [url] to add a song from YouTube to the bot's queue and start playing music in the voice channel they are in.

Stop Music: The command !stop stops the currently playing song and clears the music queue.

Pause Music: Users can pause the currently playing song with the command !pause.

Resume Music: The command !resume resumes the paused music playback.

Help Command: Users can use the !help command to get a list of available commands and their descriptions.

The bot uses Discord.js for the Discord API interaction, ytdl-core for downloading YouTube audio, and @discordjs/voice for voice channel management. It also uses embeds to display messages in a more visually appealing format.
